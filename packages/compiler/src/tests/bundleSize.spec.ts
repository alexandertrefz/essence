// NOTE: The whole point of emitting each Essence Method as its own const rather

// `packages/fixtures/files/` are the ones that reach an Essence-implemented
// Method AND a large runtime module — Everyday and Irrational both use
// `Number`, whose module drags in the numeric tower.
// Before the change each carried ~13 kB it never used; the ceilings here are a
// few kB above the measured sizes, low enough that a reintroduced spread (which
// would add those kilobytes straight back) trips them, high enough not to churn
// on an ordinary edit.
//
// NOTE: `bundle` imports esbuild lazily and costs a few hundred ms per call, so
// this is kept to the two files that actually regressed. `write: false` keeps
// it off the file system — nothing reaches disk.

	// The measured size rose from 48,261 when the `Number` comparison cluster
	// (`is`, `isNot`, `toString` and the `isLessThan` family) moved into
	// Essence: each is now emitted as its own const reading the covering
	// `compare`, so an Everyday Program that compares Numbers carries those
	// bodies. It rose ~900 bytes again when String's derivable Methods
	// followed — a String Method now pulls in the small chain it is written on
	// (`length` -> `characters` -> `split`) instead of one native, and
	// ~1,300 more when List's did, for the same reason: `firstItem` now brings
	// `item`, `removeFirst` brings `slice` and `length`, and so on. It fell
	// back to 55,163 when List's equality Methods took an `Equatable` bound:
	// `contains`, `removeDuplicates` and the by-value `count`/`removeEvery`
	// lost their natives, and what replaced them is written on chains the
	// Program already carried. It fell to 55,407 when anchoring esbuild's
	// working directory to the runtime took the checkout's path back out of
	// every inlined module's label, which is worth about 370 bytes here and
	// over a kilobyte to anyone whose checkout sits deeper. It now measures
	// 44,190: the in-house bigint-rational core replaced `bigint-fraction`,
	// whose CJS-only bundle — ~9.4 kB no tree shaking could reach, plus the
	// interop wrappers esbuild grew around it — rode in every Program that
	// touched a Rational. The ceiling moved down with it, keeping ~1.3 kB of

	// instead of falling off its end and answering `undefined`, and that helper
	// — like the rest of the runtime's Type Module — is carried by every

	// it fell to 43,851 when the module labels lost the checkout's path, for

	//
	// NOTE: Counted as well as measured. The count is what the claim actually
	// IS — one const per Method, whatever it weighs — and it is taken against
	// the ONE prelude Module rather than against itself, because a second copy
	// would not be spelled alike: esbuild renames a colliding top-level name,
	// so two `$es_List_sorted` become `$es_List_sorted` and `$es_List_sorted2`

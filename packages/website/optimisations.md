# Optimisations

The Essence Compiler runs an optimisation phase between simplifying a Program
and generating JavaScript from it. Everything it does there is a named pass, and
every pass is on this page.

That is a rule rather than a convention: a transform with no name is one nobody
can turn off, and a Program that misbehaves under an optimising Compiler is only
diagnosable if the optimisations can be taken away one at a time.

```sh
essence build App.es --no-optimise                              # the Program as written
essence build App.es --without-optimisation collapse-construction   # one pass off
```

`--without-optimisation` is repeatable and takes the exact name a pass is
documented under here. A name that names no pass is refused, with the list.

## The contract

**Any subset of the passes is a correct Program.** No pass depends on another
having run — they cooperate, in that one leaves a shape the next can do more
with, but each one is written against the Program the Simplifier produces and
answers correctly whether or not its neighbours ran. So turning one off is a way
of finding out which pass is wrong, not a way of finding out which combination
happens to work.

**A pass never changes what a Program does.** Not what it prints, not what it
computes, not which Diagnostics it reported — the Optimiser runs after the
Validator, so a Program that compiles compiles the same way with every pass off.
The one thing a pass may change is how much work the run does to get there.

**The standard library is optimised with your Program.** Its Methods are written
in Essence and emitted alongside the Program that reaches them, so the same
passes run over them under the same Options. `--no-optimise` means the whole
build, not half of it.

**The order is fixed.** Passes run in the order they are listed below, and a
pass added later is inserted where it belongs rather than appended.

## Passes

### `collapse-construction`

Builds a Record, a Case or a List in one allocation.

`{ x = 1 }` compiled to `Record.createRecord({ x: 1 })` — an object literal, a
call, and a second object inside the runtime copying the first and adding the
hidden Type key every value carries. A List literal allocated its array and then
a wrapper around it; a Case allocated its payload Record and copied that to
stamp the tag on. Each of them ends in an object whose shape the Compiler knows
in full, so the Compiler writes that object:

```js
{ [$type.typeKeySymbol]: "Record", x: … }
{ [$type.typeKeySymbol]: "List", value: [ … ] }
{ [$type.typeKeySymbol]: "Shape#Circle", radius: … }
```

Safe because the runtime's constructors are exactly these literals. The members
are the same, in the same order, under the same key, and every Argument is
evaluated where it was evaluated before — what is gone is the copy and the call.
A Case payload written as a literal is inlined into the Case, which is sound
because a literal is fresh: nothing else in the Program holds the value being
folded away. A payload that is anything else is spread rather than shared, so a
Record the Program is still holding is copied, exactly as the runtime copied it.

A Case with no payload keeps its constructor. `createCase` hands out one shared
instance per tag, and one instance is a better answer than a literal per
construction.

### `collapse-combinations`

Combines two Records with a spread.

`{ base with x = 1 }` compiled to `Object.assign({}, base, Record.createRecord({
x: 1 }))`: an empty object, a Record built to be read once, and a copy of both
into a third. It is now `{ ...base, x: 1 }`.

Safe because the two are the same operation on the values this language has.
`Object.assign` copies own enumerable properties — Symbol keys included — in
their own order, with a later source overwriting an earlier one, and object
spread copies the same set in the same order. Neither form reads through a
SOURCE's prototype, and no Essence value has a getter or a setter that could
tell the two apart: a spread defines each copied property outright, while
`Object.assign` assigns it, and an assignment can consult the TARGET's
prototype chain for a setter — the target here is a fresh object literal in
both forms, so there is nothing on either to find. The hidden Type key rides
along on the spread of the left-hand side. A right-hand side that is not
written as a literal is spread whole instead of member by member, which is
what `Object.assign` did with it.

## Runtime improvements

These are improvements to the runtime itself rather than to the code the
Compiler emits, so there is no pass to turn off: they are how the runtime works.
They are named here because they rest on the same properties of the language the
passes above do, and a reader checking whether an optimisation is sound should
find them in one place.

Each of them is invisible for the same reason. Every Essence value is immutable,
and the language has no operator asking whether two values are the SAME value —
only whether they are EQUAL. Nothing can therefore tell a shared value from a
freshly built one, or a remembered answer from a recomputed one.

### `interned-booleans`

There are exactly two Boolean values, so there are exactly two Boolean objects,
built once and handed out ever after. Every comparison, every `and`, every
predicate a loop asks stops allocating.

### `interned-unit-cases`

A Case with no payload carries nothing but its tag, so every value of one holds
what every other value of it holds. One instance per tag is built and handed out
ever after — which is what the builtin Choices always did with their Cases, done
for the ones a Program declares as well. The pool is bounded by how many
distinct unit Cases a Program constructs, which is a property of its text rather
than of its work.

### `reflexive-equality-fast-path`

Structural equality answers immediately when a value is compared with itself.
Equality is reflexive here — there is no value that is unequal to itself, the
way a floating-point NaN is — and Function equality was identity already.

### `grapheme-caching`

Segmenting a String into graphemes is by far the most expensive thing a String
Method does, and the position Methods ask for the same view of the same String
over and over. The view, and the count taken off it, are remembered on the value
under Symbol keys, which nothing that reads a value can see: `Object.keys`,
`Object.entries` and `Object.hasOwn` are the whole of what Record equality, the
printer and the runtime Type checks read with, and none of them sees a Symbol. A
String is immutable, so a remembered answer can not go stale.

Counting also skips the segmenter outright for ASCII, which is closed under NFC
and carries no combining marks, so each code unit stands alone as a cluster —
with the one exception of a carriage return, which Unicode joins to a following
line feed.

### `rational-reduction-caching`

A Rational's lowest-terms form is remembered on the value, under a Symbol key.
What is STORED is untouched, and so is every answer given from it: a Rational
built from 4 and 2 still HOLDS 4 and 2, equality still cross-multiplies those
raw parts — which is what lets `4/2` equal `2` — while every accessor and every
formatter goes on answering in lowest terms, so `4/2` prints `2/1` and its
`numerator` is 2, exactly as before. This is only the read side, computed once
instead of once per question.

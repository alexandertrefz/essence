# Goals
The main goal for this language is to allow the rapid prototyping akin to dynamically
and weakly typed languages like ECMAScript, while allowing to upgrade the prototype
to a proper program with the safety of static and strongly typed languages like C#.
It also should allow for a unified syntactical interface for blocking and non blocking code
– making refactoring painless and easy.

# The Essence
* Extensibility is better than completeness.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Creating correct code must be enjoyable.
* Prototyping must be fast – thus refactoring must be painless.
* Readability counts.
* There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it.
* Practicality beats purity.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Clever is seldom good.

# Features

* Memory Managed
* Compact & Readable Syntax
* All Data is Immutable

# Disclaimer
This language is still a work in progress. While the semantics could be described as stable at this point,
the syntax is still somewhat in flux. You can find the most recent and working example of syntax in
the [HelloWorld.es](testFiles/HelloWorld.es) as well as the other files in [testFiles](testFiles).
It also should be noted that the syntax is meant to be viewed with a font with code ligatures, like FiraCode.

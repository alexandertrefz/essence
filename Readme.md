# Goals
The main goal for this language is to allow the rapid prototyping akin to dynamically
and weakly typed languages like ECMAScript, while allowing to upgrade the prototype
to a proper program with the safety of static and strongly typed languages like C#.
It also should allow for a unified syntactical interface for blocking and non blocking code
– making refactoring painless and easy.

# The Essence
* Extensibility is better than completeness.
* Explicit is better than implicit.
* Creating correct code must be enjoyable.
* Prototyping must be fast – thus refactoring must be painless.
* Readability counts.
* There should be one – and preferably only one – obvious way to do it.
* Practicality beats purity.
* Simple is better than complex.
* Complex is better than complicated.
* Beautiful is better than ugly.
* Clever is seldom good.

# Features
* Static Structural Typing

* Type Inference
* Modules & Namespaces
* Interfaces
* Generics
* Named Parameters
* First-Class Functions
* Memory Managed
* Compact & Readable Syntax
* All Data is Immutable

# Example Code
You can find the most recent and working example of syntax in the [HelloWorld.es](testFiles/HelloWorld.es)
as well as the other files in [testFiles](testFiles). It also should be noted that the syntax is meant to
be viewed with a font with code ligatures, like FiraCode.

# Disclaimer
This language is still a work in progress. While the semantics could be described as stable at this point,
the syntax is still somewhat in flux.
